Nernst Potential Simulator
==========================

Nernst Potential Simulator is an educational program that allows the user to
see the behavior of ions near a semi-permeable membrane.  

Dependencies
============

This project uses code developed by the Qt, Qwt, and SFMT projects. 

To build this program, you will need to install the development tools for 
Qt 5 (https://www.qt.io/offline-installers) and the Qwt libraries (available
from qwt.sourceforge.net).  The SFMT libraries have been modified and are
included with the source code, but the project page can be found at
http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/SFMT ).

Compilation Instructions
========================
This program uses the standard Qt build process run from the src directory:

  cd src
  qmake
  make

Install Qt 5:

  - Download a Qt 5.12 offline installer:
      https://www.qt.io/offline-installers
  - Install into home directory:
      /Users/<my user name>/Qt5.12.11
  - Include prebuilt components for macOS and sources
  - Update your PATH variable in your shell's configuration file (e.g., ~/.bashrc):
      export PATH="/Users/<my user name>/Qt5.12.11/5.12.11/clang_64/bin:$PATH"

Build qwt:

  - Download the qwt 6.2.0 source code with compressed extension tar.bz2:
      https://sourceforge.net/projects/qwt/files/qwt/
  - Unpack the source code into your home directory:
      /Users/<my user name>/qwt-6.2.0
  - Comment out the line `QWT_CONFIG += QwtSvg` in qwtconfig.pri (or else
    `QT += svg` must be added to nernst.pro)
  - Build qwt:
      cd ~/qwt-6.2.0/src
      qmake -config release
      make staticlib

Build nernst:

  - Make sure the paths for qwt are correct in nernst.pro for macOS:
      INCLUDEPATH += /Users/<my user name>/qwt-6.2.0/src
      QMAKE_LIBDIR += /Users/<my user name>/qwt-6.2.0/lib
  - Build nernst:
      cd nernst/src
      qmake -config release
      make
      macdeployqt "Nernst Potential Simulator.app"
